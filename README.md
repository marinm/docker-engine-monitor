## About

Browser client to the [Docker Engine API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api) (v1.41).

## Screenshot

## Setup

### What I'm using

- Mac mini, M1 2020
- MacOS 12.6
- Docker Desktop 4.12
- Node 18.9
- npm 8.19

### Docker HTTP Server

This monitor is a TCP client.

See `src/config.js`.

_By default the Docker daemon (`dockerd`) binds to a Unix-domain socket for serving the HTTP-based API. But Docker can also be configured to have the daemon bind to a TCP port instead. Look for the socket option on the `dockerd` [reference page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-socket-option)._

I had trouble with the former approach, and didn't want to bother to figure it out. A quick hack is to write a proxy script that reads from the Unix-domain socket, binds to a TCP port, and passes messages in both directions. You will have to do this on your own. üçâ

### Starting the monitor

```
npm install
npm run start
```
